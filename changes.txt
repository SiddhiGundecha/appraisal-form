# Changes and Findings

## Startup Unified Command
- Installed `concurrently` as a dev dependency in `appraisal-form`.
- Added `dev:all` script to `appraisal-form/package.json`.
  - Command: `concurrently "npm run dev" "python ../appraisal_dp/appraisal_backend/manage.py runserver"`
  - Note: Ensure virtual environment is activated before running.


## Unused Code/Files Identified
- `d:\Antigravity\appraisal-form\app_form_dup.jsx`: Deleted (unused duplicate of `src/pages/faculty/AppraisalForm.jsx`).
- `d:\Antigravity\appraisal-form\src\styles\FacultyAppraisalForm2.css`: Deleted (unused CSS file).
- `authentication_skeleton` (Backend App): Noted as potentially unused (registered in `settings.py` but not present in `urls.py`).


## Code Refinements
- `d:\Antigravity\appraisal-form\src\pages\faculty\AppraisalForm.jsx`:
  - Removed/Commented out debug `console.log` statements for payload debugging.
- General project check: Verified that logic remains unchanged as requested.
